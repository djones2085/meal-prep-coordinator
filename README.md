# Meal Prep Coordinator

Always check project files for existing pages and functionality. Stay DRY!

A web application for coordinating meal preparation among a group of people, managing recipes, orders, and meal cycles.
## Next Focus

- **Measurement Conversion for Shopping Lists:** (In Progress)
    - Implement robust measurement conversion for ingredients, especially to handle large quantities (e.g., for 20-30 servings), scaling units appropriately (e.g., grams to kilograms, ml to liters, small units to larger common units).
    - **Sub-tasks for Measurement Conversion:**
        - **1. Define Conversion Ratios:** Establish a comprehensive set of conversion factors (e.g., tsp to tbsp, tbsp to cup, g to kg, ml to L, oz to lb, common metric/imperial volume and weight units).
        - **2. Create Utility Function/Module:** Develop a reusable JavaScript/TypeScript module (e.g., `src/utils/measurementConverter.js`) that includes:
            - A function `convertMeasurement(quantity, fromUnit, toUnit)`.
            - A function `simplifyMeasurement(quantity, unit)` to convert to the most practical larger common unit (e.g., 96 tsp to 2 cups).
        - **3. Standardize Unit Strings:** Define and use a consistent set of unit strings (e.g., 'g', 'kg', 'tsp', 'tbsp', 'cup', 'ml', 'l', 'oz', 'lb', 'unit').
        - **4. Handle Non-Convertible Units:** Gracefully manage units that don't convert (e.g., 'clove', 'pinch', 'unit') or conversions that are not possible (e.g., weight to volume without density).
        - **5. Integration with Shopping List Generation:** Incorporate the conversion utility into the backend (Cloud Function, e.g., `_performAggregation`) when the shopping list is generated. Aggregated quantities should be stored with practical units.
        - **6. Frontend Display Adjustments:** Update frontend components (e.g., `ShopperShoppingListPage.jsx`, `AdminShoppingList.jsx`) to correctly display these potentially converted units and quantities.
        - **7. Testing:** Thoroughly test with various units, quantities, and edge cases.

### Core Setup âœ…
- âœ… React (Vite) frontend
- âœ… Firebase integration (Auth, Firestore, Functions, Storage, Hosting)
- âœ… Git repository
- âœ… Basic routing (React Router)
- âœ… Page components structure
- âœ… MUI integration
- âœ… Layout component

### Authentication ðŸŸ¡
- âœ… Email/Password sign-up/login
- âœ… Global auth state (React Context)
- âœ… Protected routes
- âœ… Logout functionality
- âœ… Firestore user profile creation on signup
- âœ… Role-based access control (Admin vs Regular users) - *Frontend routes protected using roles from Firestore. Admin links in UI are conditional. Unauthorized access attempts are handled with notifications. Includes an admin page for user management where roles (`user`, `admin`, `cook`, `shopper`) can be assigned.*
- âœ… Email confirmation - *Users must verify email after signup. Redirects to verification page with resend option.*
- âœ… User invites system - *Admins can generate invite links via an admin page. Invitees use a special link to sign up. Firestore `invites` collection tracks status. Cloud Function `createInvite` handles invite generation. Security rules in place.*
    - âœ… Admin can generate a unique invite link for an email.
    - âœ… Invitee uses the link to access a special sign-up page.
    - âœ… On sign-up, invite status is updated.
    - âœ… Firestore collection: `invites` (stores `invitedEmail`, `status` \\["pending", "accepted", "expired"\\], `createdAt`, `createdBy` (admin UID), `acceptedByUid`, `acceptedAt`).
    - ðŸ”˜ [Future]: Automated email sending for invites.
    - ðŸ”˜ [Future]: Non-admins can invite to households.
- âœ… Password Reset/Change:
    - âœ… User can request a password reset email (`ForgotPasswordPage.jsx`).
    - âœ… Logged-in user can change their password (`ChangePasswordPage.jsx`).
- âœ… Password Strength Enforcement:
    - âœ… Secure passwords required for new user sign-up (`SignUpPage.jsx`).
    - âœ… Secure passwords required for password changes (`ChangePasswordPage.jsx`).
- ðŸ”˜ Household management

### Recipe Management âœ…
- âœ… Data model defined
- âœ… Firestore rules for read/create
- âœ… Bulk upload script
- âœ… Manual Add Recipe form
- âœ… Recipe List (RecipesPage)
- âœ… Recipe Detail (RecipeDetailPage)
- ðŸ”˜ [Future]Recipe photo uploads/display
- ðŸ”˜ Agent: Recipe Processing (Parse unstructured text, standardize units/format, apply standards like protein goals, create structured recipe object)
- âœ… Recipe Notes: Field for general cooking tips, source, variations, chef-to-chef advice on the recipe itself
    - ðŸ”˜ [Future]: Enhance security rules to restrict read access to notes by role (e.g., 'cook') by moving notes to a subcollection and applying role-based server-side validation for all CRUD operations on notes.
- âœ… Status management
- âœ… Shopping list generation (Basic) - *Enhanced to generate a structured `shoppingList` object in `mealCycle` doc via Cloud Function (`_performAggregation`). Includes item details for aggregated quantity, on-hand tracking, and to-be-purchased calculation. Status: `pending_approval` initially.*
- ðŸ”˜ Ensure intelligent unit conversions (e.g., 30 tsp to 1.25 cups) for practicality.


### Meal Cycle Workflow ðŸŸ¡
- âœ… Basic cycle creation (Admin)
- âœ… Admin configurable cycle defaults (deadline, cook date)
- âœ… Order submission (Users)
- âœ… User order modifications (e.g., "no cheese", "extra sauce"; pre-defined & free-text 'Other' option) - *Implemented by allowing recipes to define a list of `predefinedCustomizations` (checkboxes) and a flag `allowFreeTextCustomization` for a general text note on orders. These are saved with the order.*
- âœ… Track order type: Dine-in (glass container) vs. Carry-out (to-go container) based on user document - *User's `locationStatus` preference (e.g., 'dine_in', 'carry_out') is saved with each order. Cloud Functions aggregate counts for `dineInContainers` and `carryOutContainers` per meal cycle.*
- âœ… Users can modify their submitted orders before the deadline (from dashboard/order history) - *Implemented in `DashboardPage.jsx` with deadline checks and Firestore rule support.*
- âœ… View order history (Users)
- âœ… Order aggregation
- ðŸ”˜ Store scaled recipe (ingredients, instructions) in mealCycle document after aggregation/scaling
- âœ… Status management
- ðŸ”˜ [Future]fAssign roles (cook, shopper) for specific meal cycles
- ðŸ”˜ [Future]Voting system
- ðŸ”˜ [Future]Distribution tracking
- ðŸ”˜ Feedback collection (app specific feedback)
- ðŸ”˜ Feedback: Specific feedback channel/form for shoppers
- ðŸ”˜ Feedback: Eater ratings/comments for cooks (e.g., 5-star system)
- ðŸ”˜ Agent: Cook Sequencing (Optimize cooking task order based on prep/cook times and target completion)

### Shopping & Cooking Workflow ðŸŸ¡
- âœ… Basic shopping list data generation (ingredients and quantities in mealCycle doc) - *Superseded by enhanced generation in Recipe Management. This item refers to the new structured list.*
- âœ… Shopping list: Admin approval step - *Backend function `handleApproveShoppingList` in `MealCycleManagementPage.jsx` used by `AdminShoppingList.jsx` component.*
- âœ… Shopping list: Editable by admin/shopper - *'On hand' quantities can be edited after list approval.*
- âœ… Shopping list: Shopper can mark items as 'available on hand' - *Implemented via direct 'on hand' quantity editing and a 'Mark as Acquired' button for ease of use.*
- âœ… Shopping list: Dedicated page for Shoppers to view and update item status (on hand, acquired).
- ðŸ”˜ Chef/Cook: Ingredient checklist before starting to cook
- âœ… Chef/Cook: Access to historical cook notes for the current recipe
- âœ… Manage packaging (e.g., container types, labels)

### User Interface ðŸŸ¡
- âœ… Basic responsive layout
- âœ… Material-UI components
- âœ… Loading states
- âœ… Error handling
- âœ… User input validation/UX improvements (e.g., order quantity field behavior).
- ðŸ”˜ Enhanced meal cycle page: Display user names, order counts, and dine-in/carry-out status per user
- âœ… User dashboard: Order history display - *Updated to show Recipe Name as primary, removed Order/Cycle ID and status.*
- âœ… Navbar: Transparent style with updated icon/title colors.
- âœ… Branding: Set application title and browser tab favicon.
- ðŸ”˜ [Future]Advanced state management (Zustand/Redux)
- ðŸ”˜ [Future]PWA capabilities
- ðŸ”˜ [Future]Notifications (FCM)
- ðŸŸ¡ [In Progress]UI/UX polish
- ðŸ”˜ Automated testing

### Backend Services ðŸŸ¡
- âœ… Basic Cloud Functions
- âœ… Order aggregation - *Cloud Functions `_performAggregation` and `_recalculateCycleTotalsAndIngredients` handle aggregation. `_performAggregation` is triggered automatically when a cycle's status changes to `ordering_closed` (if not already aggregated) and also by a scheduled job. `_recalculateCycleTotalsAndIngredients` updates counts when orders are written.*
- âœ… Real-time updates
- ðŸ”˜ Cloud Function: Update recipe stats (lastPreparedDate, timesPrepared) on meal cycle completion
- ðŸ”˜ [Future]AI Services integration
- ðŸ”˜ Suggested Frameworks: CrewAI, Google ADK for multi-agent workflows (Recipe Processing, Shopping List, Cook Sequencing)
- ðŸ”˜ Data modeling consideration: Evolve 'cook' representation to 'cook_session' for better tracking
- âœ… Advanced security rules - *Initial role-based rules implemented (users, recipes, mealCycles, orders); admins have broader permissions, users restricted. MealCycles not deletable. Updated mealCycle rules to allow shoppers to update shoppingList.items with lastUpdatedAt timestamp. Further review and refinement pending.*

## Future AI / Agent-Based Features ðŸ”˜
