    "Prepare Protein: Cook/prepare your chosen protein according to the Protein Options section (e.g., sear Canadian bacon, warm lobster).",
    "Make Hollandaise: Fill a saucepan with 1 inch water, simmer. Place a heatproof bowl over (not touching water). Whisk egg yolks, lemon juice, Dijon until slightly thickened. Slowly whisk in warm melted butter until emulsified and glossy. Season with cayenne and salt. Thin with 1-2 tsp warm water if needed. Keep warm over water bath (off heat).",
    "Poach Eggs: Bring a wide pan of water with vinegar and salt to a gentle simmer (~190°F/88°C). Crack eggs into individual small bowls. Create a gentle whirlpool. Slide eggs in (up to 4 at a time). Poach 3-4 minutes for runny yolks. Remove with slotted spoon, drain on paper towels.",
    "Assemble: Place 2 base halves on each plate. Top each half with prepared protein. Gently place a poached egg on top of the protein.",
    "Sauce: Generously spoon warm hollandaise over each egg (~2 tbsp per egg).",
    "Garnish: Finish with finely chopped chives, microgreens, a tiny dot of caviar, or a dusting of smoked paprika."
