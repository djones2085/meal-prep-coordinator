    "Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in a large bowl.",
    "Add cold butter cubes. Using a pastry cutter or fingers, quickly cut butter into the flour until mixture resembles coarse meal with pea-sized crumbs.",
    "Make a well in the center and pour in the cold buttermilk. Stir with a fork just until the dough comes together (do not overmix).",
    "Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently pat into a 1-inch-thick rectangle.",
    "Fold the dough in half onto itself. Pat down gently. Rotate the dough 90 degrees. Repeat this folding and patting process 3 more times (4 folds total) to create flaky layers.",
    "Pat the dough to a final thickness of about ¾-inch.",
    "Using a 3-inch round cutter dipped in flour, cut out 8 biscuits. Push straight down; do not twist the cutter. Gather scraps gently, re-pat, and cut remaining biscuits if needed.",
    "Place biscuits 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet.",
    "Optional Egg Wash: Whisk the egg with 1 tbsp water. Lightly brush the tops of the biscuits.",
    "Bake for 15–18 minutes, or until golden brown and risen.",
    "Let cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack. Split horizontally with a fork just before serving for best texture."
