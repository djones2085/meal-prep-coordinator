  "instructions": [
    "Smoke Turkey (Day Before or Morning Of): Season 8 oz turkey breast with a pinch of smoked paprika, garlic powder, thyme, and black pepper. Smoke at 225°F for ~1–1.5 hours until internal temperature reaches 165°F. Cool, wrap, and refrigerate. Thick-slice (¼–½ inch) into two 4 oz portions. Store in an airtight container (fridge, 5–7 days).",
    "Cook Bacon: Preheat oven to 400°F. Lay 6 bacon strips on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake 15–18 minutes until crispy. Drain on paper towels, cool, and store in an airtight container (fridge, 5–7 days).",
    "Prep Vegetables: Wash and dry 4 lettuce leaves. Slice tomato into 4 thin slices. Store separately in an airtight container with a paper towel (fridge, 3–5 days).",
    "Prepare Pickled Onions (Optional): Thinly slice ¼ small red onion. Combine in a small jar with 2 tbsp vinegar, 2 tbsp water, ¼ tsp sugar, and pinch of salt. Shake and refrigerate for 1 hour (lasts 2 weeks).",
    "Store Bread: Store 4 slices of sourdough or ciabatta in a bread box or wrapped in a clean towel. If freezing, thaw slices as needed.",
    "Toast Bread (Day-Of, Optional): Lightly toast 2 slices of bread per sandwich for texture.",
    "Apply Spread: Spread 1–2 tsp of either garlic-herb aioli or spicy honey mustard on each slice (choose based on preference).",
    "Layer First Sandwich: Place 2 lettuce leaves on one slice (moisture barrier). Add 4 oz thick-sliced smoked turkey. Layer 3 bacon strips. Add 2 tomato slices. Slice or mash ½ avocado, add fresh with a squeeze of lime juice (optional). Optionally add 1 tbsp pickled onions, ½ tbsp microgreens, and a pinch of flaky sea salt and pepper.",
    "Finish First Sandwich: Top with the second slice of bread, spread-side down. Press gently.",
    "Repeat for Second Sandwich: Follow same layering process for remaining ingredients.",
    "Wrap for Transport: Wrap each sandwich tightly in parchment paper or foil for portability. Store in an insulated lunch bag with an ice pack if transporting."

  "cookNotes": [
    "Avocado: Store whole avocado in the fridge (lasts 3–5 days). Slice or mash day-of for freshness. Optionally, pre-scoop avocado halves, wrap tightly with lime juice, and refrigerate (1–2 days).",
    "Storage: Keep components (bread, turkey, bacon, veggies) separate until assembly to prevent sogginess. Assemble morning-of for best results.",
    "Serving: Two sandwiches provide ~½ lb total protein (8 oz turkey). Adjust bacon or turkey slightly for lighter or heavier portions if desired.",
    "Turkey can be smoked in advance and stored for up to a week, making this an excellent meal prep option.",
    "For best results, use a meat thermometer to ensure turkey reaches 165°F internal temperature."
