  "instructions": [
    "Prep Potatoes (Day Before or Morning Of): Dice ½ potato into ½-inch cubes. Soak in cold water for 15–20 minutes to remove starch. Drain and pat dry with a clean towel. Toss with ½ tsp olive oil, ¼ tsp smoked paprika, pinch of garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Spread on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Roast at 425°F for 15–20 minutes, flipping halfway, until crispy and golden. Cool and store in an airtight container (fridge, 3–5 days).",
    "Cook Bacon: Preheat oven to 400°F. Lay 2 bacon strips on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake 12–15 minutes until crispy. Drain on paper towels, cool, and crumble. Store crumbles in an airtight container (fridge, 5–7 days).",
    "Cook Ground Beef: Heat a skillet or griddle over medium-high heat (400°F if using a 36\" propane griddle). Add 8 oz ground beef, season with ¼ tsp kosher salt, ⅛ tsp black pepper, and ⅛ tsp onion powder. Cook 5–6 minutes, breaking into crumbles, until browned and cooked through (internal temp 160°F). Drain excess fat. Cool and store in an airtight container (fridge, 3–5 days).",
    "Prep Lettuce: Wash and chop 1 cup lettuce. Dry thoroughly and store in an airtight container with a paper towel (fridge, 3–5 days).",
    "Prep Burger Sauce (if making): Mix 1 tbsp mayo, ½ tbsp ketchup, ½ tsp relish, ¼ tsp mustard, and a pinch of smoked paprika. Store in a small jar (fridge, 5–7 days).",
    "Prepare Pickled Onions (Optional): Thinly slice a few rings of red onion (~⅛ small onion). Combine in a small jar with 1 tbsp vinegar, 1 tbsp water, ⅛ tsp sugar, and a pinch of salt. Shake and refrigerate for 1 hour (lasts 2 weeks).",
    "Reheat Base (Day-Of, Optional): Microwave roasted potatoes (~4 oz) for 30–45 seconds or re-crisp in a skillet over medium heat for 2 minutes. Place warm or room-temperature potatoes in a bowl as the base.",
    "Layer Ingredients: Add 1 cup chopped lettuce over potatoes. Top with 8 oz cooked ground beef crumbles. Sprinkle ~½ oz bacon crumbles. Add ¼ cup shredded cheddar. Optionally add 1 tbsp pickled onions and ½ tsp chopped chives or parsley.",
    "Finish: Drizzle 2 tbsp burger sauce over the top or serve on the side for freshness.",
    "Serve or Store: If eating immediately, serve in a wide, shallow bowl. If transporting, assemble in a meal prep container, keeping sauce separate until eating. Use an insulated lunch bag with an ice pack."

  "cookNotes": [
    "Protein: Uses ½ lb ground beef per bowl, matching preference for hearty protein portions. Bacon (~½ oz) adds flavor without overwhelming.",
    "Serving Size: Non-beef ingredients are scaled for a single, reasonable serving (e.g., 1 cup lettuce, ¼ cup cheese, 4 oz potatoes).",
    "Storage: Store components (potatoes, beef, bacon, lettuce, cheese, sauce) separately in airtight containers to prevent sogginess. Assemble morning-of or at mealtime for best results.",
    "High-End Touch: House-made burger sauce and optional pickled onions keep the bowl elevated, while sharp cheddar and crispy potatoes add a gourmet feel.",
    "Alternative: Can substitute store-bought In-N-Out-style sauce if preferred over homemade version."
