  "instructions": [
    "Cook the Pork Loin: Season 2 lbs pork loin with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Sear in hot skillet with 1 tbsp oil over medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes per side until golden (internal temp ~130°F). Cool slightly, then slice thinly (1/8-inch). Divide into 4 portions (1/2 lb each).",
    "Wrap Pork in Butcher Paper: Cut 4 sheets of butcher paper (~12x12 inches). Place one pork portion in center of each sheet. Fold paper tightly around pork, tucking edges to prevent leaks. Secure with kitchen twine or food-safe tape.",
    "Prepare Flavor Base: In each of 4 meal prep containers, add: 1 tsp miso paste, 1 tsp soy sauce, 1/2 tsp sesame oil, 1/4 tsp chili oil (if using), 1/2 tsp bouillon powder, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp dried shiitake mushrooms, and 1 tbsp dried seaweed.",
    "Add Dry Ingredients: Place 2 oz dried noodles on top of flavor base in each container. Add 1/4 cup shredded carrots, 1/4 cup dried spinach/kale/cabbage, 1 tbsp dried corn/peas (if using), and white parts of green onions to each container.",
    "Add Wrapped Pork: Place one butcher paper packet in each meal prep container, on top of or beside dry ingredients. This keeps all components in one container while maintaining pork separation.",
    "Store: Reserve green onion greens and any fresh toppings in separate airtight containers. Seal meal prep containers and refrigerate for up to 3 days (shorter timeframe due to butcher paper breathability).",
    "Day-Of Assembly: Remove container from fridge. Unwrap pork packet (discard/compost paper). Add sliced pork to container with noodles. Pour 2 cups boiling water over everything, ensuring pork and noodles are submerged. Stir gently to dissolve flavor base.",
    "Final Steps: Cover and let sit 4-6 minutes until noodles are soft and pork is heated through (165°F). Add green onion greens and any fresh toppings. Serve hot."

    "Designed for one-meal-a-day diet with 1/2 lb pork per serving for substantial protein.",
    "All components stored in single container for maximum convenience."
