  "instructions": [
    "Prepare Berry Compote: Combine berries, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, lemon juice, and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook until berries soften (8-10 min). Optional: For thicker compote, mix cornstarch with 1 tbsp cold water, stir into the simmering compote, and cook 1-2 min more until thickened. Remove from heat, stir in 1 tsp vanilla and optional lemon zest. Let cool.",
    "Prepare Whipped Cream: In a chilled bowl, whip 1 cup heavy cream, powdered sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla extract with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Refrigerate.",
    "Prepare French Toast Batter: Whisk eggs, milk, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 2 tbsp granulated sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, cinnamon, and optional nutmeg in a large bowl.",
    "Soak Bread: Add bread cubes to the egg mixture and gently toss to coat. Let soak for 2-3 minutes, ensuring they absorb the liquid but don't become overly soggy.",
    "Cook French Toast Bites: Melt butter in a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add soaked bread cubes in a single layer (cook in batches if necessary). Cook until golden brown on all sides, turning frequently (about 5-7 minutes per batch).",
    "Assemble: Arrange warm French toast bites on plates or a platter. Top generously with homemade whipped cream and a spoonful of the berry compote. Garnish with a dusting of powdered sugar or additional fresh berries if desired.",
    "Serve: Serve immediately. Offer maple syrup on the side (optional)."
