  "instructions": [
    "Sunday Prep (Salmon): Preheat oven to 275°F (135°C). Place salmon on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and season liberally with salt and pepper. Roast for 20-30 minutes until it flakes easily. Cool completely, then gently flake into large pieces and divide among 5 airtight containers.",
    "Sunday Prep (Aioli): In a bowl, mix mayonnaise, the zest and juice of one lemon, chopped dill, chopped capers, and freshly ground black pepper. Divide this mixture into 5 small, sealed condiment containers.",
    "Sunday Prep (The Crunch): Finely dice the celery and shallot. Divide this mixture among 5 small bags or containers.",
    "Sunday Prep (Pickled Onions): Thinly slice the red onion and pack it into a jar. In a saucepan, bring apple cider vinegar, water, sugar, and 1 tsp salt to a simmer. Pour the hot liquid over the onions. Let cool, then refrigerate. They will be ready in about an hour.",
    "Sunday Prep (The Vehicle): Portion out crackers into 5 separate bags.",
    "Weekday Assembly: To serve, grab one container of salmon, one aioli, and one bag of the celery/shallot mixture.",

  "cookNotes": [
    "Slow-roasting salmon at a low temperature yields an exceptionally moist and tender texture, perfect for salads.",
    "Using a high-quality store-bought mayonnaise is a great shortcut for the lemon-dill aioli.",
    "The quick-pickled red onions add a bright, acidic crunch and will last for several weeks in the refrigerator.",
    "For the best texture and freshness, assemble the salad just before eating."
