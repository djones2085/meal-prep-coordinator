  "instructions": [
    "Prep the Wings: Pat wings dry. Toss with kosher salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and smoked paprika. Let sit at room temp for 30 mins (or fridge up to 4 hours).",
    "Set Up Breading Station: Prepare two shallow bowls. Dredge: Whisk buttermilk, 1 tbsp hot sauce, 1 tsp salt, and optional 1 tsp cayenne. Coating: Mix flour, cornstarch, 1 tbsp smoked paprika, 1 tbsp garlic powder, onion powder, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper, and 1 tsp cayenne.",
    "Heat the Lard: In a heavy pot/Dutch oven, melt pork lard over medium-high heat to 325°F (163°C). Ensure 2-3 inches depth.",
    "Bread the Wings: Working in batches, dip wings in buttermilk dredge (let excess drip), then coat thoroughly in flour-cornstarch mix (press lightly). Shake off excess. Rest on a wire rack for 10 minutes.",
    "First Fry (Low Temp): Carefully add wings to 325°F lard in batches (don't overcrowd). Fry for 6-8 minutes until par-cooked and starting to crisp. Remove and drain on a wire rack. Cool for 10-15 minutes.",
    "Second Fry (High Temp): Increase lard temperature to 375°F (190°C). Fry wings again in batches for 2-4 minutes until deep golden brown and very crispy. Drain on the wire rack.",
    "Make Buffalo Sauce: Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in Frank's RedHot, honey, Worcestershire, and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. Simmer for 2-3 minutes until combined. Keep warm.",
    "Toss and Serve: Place hot, double-fried wings in a large bowl. Pour warm buffalo sauce over wings and toss to coat evenly. Serve immediately with optional celery and dip."

  "cookNotes": [
    "Pork Lard adds rich, savory depth.",
    "Double Fry Technique: First fry cooks the meat gently, second fry at higher temp creates maximum crispiness.",
    "Two-Step Breading: Buttermilk helps coating adhere and adds tang; Flour/Cornstarch mix provides the crunchy shell.",
    "Resting wings after breading helps the coating set.",
    "Resting between fries is crucial for the double-fry effect.",
    "Adjust cayenne pepper in dredge and coating based on heat preference."
